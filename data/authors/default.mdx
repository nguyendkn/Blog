<p className="mt-6 text-base text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
  <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Meet <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Đào Khôi Nguyên</span>, a dude from <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Hanoi</span>, a city that doesn't rain like Vancouver but is sunny enough to melt my ice cream every time I try to dash outside for a treat. As a kiddo, instead of dismantling toys (and facing the wrath of mom for failing to put them back together), I found myself utterly smitten by <span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>technology</span>. With <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>7 years</span> in software and another <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>4 diving deep into Digital Marketing</span>, I'm currently the "Tech Manager" of the technical room at <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Novaon Digital</span>. </p>
  <p style={{marginBottom: '10px'}}>Mention <span style={{fontWeight: 'bold', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>technical</span>, and my spirit just lights up! Living life with zest and an insatiable curiosity, I’m on an endless journey of researching and integrating nifty tech like <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>.net core, angular, redis</span>, and the squad of <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>SQLServer, elasticsearch, nodejs, python, ubuntu, and the macbook pro M1</span> into our products and services. After wrapping up each project, I often ponder, "Hey Khôi Nguyên, ever thought about becoming a <span style={{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>mentor</span>?" </p>
  <p>And the answer is always a resounding: "Absolutely!" I aspire to be a guide in the <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>tech</span> and <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>programming</span> realm, aiding the younglings so they don't have to face the same bumps and hiccups I did when starting out. And... perhaps also to occasionally show off a tad about all the cool stuff I know! 😂😉 </p>
